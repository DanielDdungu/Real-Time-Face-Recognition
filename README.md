# Real-Time-Face-Recognition
Real-time face recognition and classification system is an important security system of Image processing owing to its use in many institution security fields such as airports, Offices, University, ATM, Bank and in many locations with a security system [1] . Real-time refers to the actual time during which a process takes place or an event occurs. Face recognition is the automated searching of a facial image in a computer database, typically resulting in a group of facial images ranked by computer-evaluated similarity [2] . This recognition is done using biometric technology and forensics. Face recognition system should be able to automatically detect a face in an image. This involves extraction of its features and then recognizing it, regardless of lighting, expression, illumination, aging, transformations (translate, rotate and scale image) and pose. Feature extraction includes extracting landmarks on the face and analyzing the features using the algorithm to obtain their relative position, size, and/or shape of the eyes, nose, cheekbones, and jaw.
